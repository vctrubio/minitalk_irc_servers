ok so first we have a newline in channels that i dont like
second need to work on presentation, but maybe thats last. how the message is presented and terminal output basically
When someone joins, post to channel, new user 

OK- need to deal with 1 subject commands
2 ....
3 /msg USER topic 

/leave X
/topic X [new_topic]: Display or set the topic of channel X
/whois X


- it stalls when its over MAX_CLIENTS

What I'm doing
-throw catch and release
