- IRC SYNTAX


◦ You must be able to authenticate, set a nickname, a username, join a channel, send and receive private messages using your reference client.
(WHAT is authenticatio?)

◦ All the messages sent from one client to a channel have to be forwarded to every other client that joined the channel.
(THIS is good)

◦ You must have operators and regular users.
(YES we have, but admin can set other people as admin?)

◦ Then, you have to implement the commands that are specific to operators.
(HMMM??)
